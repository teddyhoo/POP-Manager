The Company is also recalling one lot of Rad Cat Raw Diet Pasture-Raised Venison Recipe because testing results indicate it has the potential to  be contaminated with Shiga Toxin producing E. coli O121. These pathogens can cause serious and potentially fatal infections in animals consuming the pet food and in humans that handle the pet food and surfaces exposed to the product. This recall is being conducted out of an abundance of caution. Due to Radagast Pet Food’s commitment to food safety and quality, The Company is conducting this voluntary recall.",

Healthy people exposed to Listeria monocytogenes should monitor themselves for some or all of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, aches, abdominal cramping, and fever. These pathogens can cause serious and potentially fatal infections in animals consuming the pet food and in humans that handle the pet food and surfaces exposed to the product. There is risk to humans from handling contaminated pet products, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products or any surfaces exposed to these products. Consumers exhibiting these signs after having contact with this product should contact their healthcare providers.",

Animals exposed to Listeria monocytogenes can display short-term symptoms such as: vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscular or respiratory signs and anorexia. Animals can shed Listeria monocytogenes through their feces onto their coats and into the home environment and thus serve as sources of infection to humans and other animals in the household. If your pet has consumed the recalled product and has these symptoms, please contact your veterinarian.",

People handling or consuming raw pet foods contaminated with this pathogenic bacterium can lead to E. coli infections. E. coli O121 can cause symptoms which include severe stomach cramps, mild fever and vomiting, and diarrhea, often with bloody stools. Animals can shed Listeria monocytogenes through their feces onto their coats and into the home environment and thus serve as sources of infection to humans and other animals in the household.
